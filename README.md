# Real Time Clock App

This App serves multiple purposes: it can function as a clock and also serves as a practical example to study key React concepts such as the usage of the useState Hook and the application of the setInterval JavaScript function.

By utilizing the useState Hook, the App maintains and updates its state to display the current time. The useState Hook allows for the management of state variables within functional components, enabling us to leverage React's state-based architecture.

Furthermore, the setInterval function is employed to update the time displayed by the App at regular intervals. This function invokes a specified callback function repeatedly based on a defined time interval, ensuring that the displayed time remains accurate and up to date.

By combining these concepts, this App offers a practical implementation of a clock while simultaneously providing a valuable learning opportunity to grasp the fundamentals of React's useState Hook and the usage of the setInterval function in JavaScript.

Feel free to explore and enhance the App's functionality or modify it according to your specific requirements.
